[Describe in a few words what you did in the first part of the compiler project
(the non-optional labs)]Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod

[and briefly say what problem you want to solve with
your extension.] In the process of writing our compiler we faced major issues for writing tool programs. Without a way to debug our tool programs, we can't know for sure wether a given bug is due to our compiler or our program. We therefore found it could be useful not only for us but also for future iterations of this course to have a tool language debugger. 

This extension does not involve many modifications of the previously achieved work but requires a bit of additionnal software. 



This section should convince us that you have a clear picture of the general
architecture of your compiler and that you understand how your extension fits
in it.
