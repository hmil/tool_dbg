During the semester, we have implemented a full compiler for Tool written in Scala. It outputs Java byte code, and can consequently run on the JVM.

Throughout this period, we had the occasion to write quite a number of Tool programs, which allowed us to notice that it could be tedious to debug Tool code. That's why we chose to develop a debugger for Tool.

\subsection{Features}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Load Tool source files, or develop directly in the web IDE
\item Set breakpoints in the code
\item Step-by-step execution: step over lines, step into / out function calls
\item See the value of every variable
%\item See the current callstack
\item Real-time compilation
\end{enumerate}

To avoid the need of downloading extra software, we chose to make our debugger run in the browser.

%[and briefly say what problem you want to solve with
%your extension.] In the process of writing our compiler we faced major issues %for writing tool programs. Without a way to debug our tool programs, we can't %know for sure wether a given bug is due to our compiler or our program. We %therefore found it could be useful not only for us but also for future %iterations of this course to have a tool language debugger. 

%This extension does not involve many modifications of the previously achieved %work but requires a bit of additionnal software. 



%This section should convince us that you have a clear picture of the general
%architecture of your compiler and that you understand how your extension fits
%in it.
